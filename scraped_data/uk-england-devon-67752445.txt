An extra £2.3m has been committed to plans to build a new adult care facility in Plymouth. The city council had previously earmarked £10.5m for the centre on the edge of Central Park for adults with learning disabilities. It is to replace The Vine in Whitleigh and Colwill Lodge in Estover. The new funding would also cover an increase in the cost of materials and to make the facility more environmentally-friendly, staff said. Mary Aspinall, council cabinet member for Health and Adult Social Care, said the authority was "absolutely committed to this project". She said: "It will provide a vitally important service to some of our most vulnerable residents and their families. "The facility has been designed in consultation with users to ensure that it meets their needs and will help to maximise independence and education, while also providing space for relaxation and entertainment." She added that a "combination of recent major global events, including the Covid-19 pandemic" were partially to blame for increasing costs of the project. But she said the council was "dedicated to supporting adults with learning disabilities in Plymouth and I'm pleased that we're able to allocate extra funding to make this facility a reality, as it will make a huge difference to people's lives." The new facility will include seven en-suite bedrooms and seven self-contained flats. There will also be different spaces for activities, including sensory rooms, art rooms, gardens and a kitchen.
