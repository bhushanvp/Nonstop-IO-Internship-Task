The police are investigating up to 50 potential breaches of laws providing safe access zones (SAZs) outside abortion clinics in Northern Ireland.  The zones came into effect in September at eight clinics in Northern Ireland. More incidents were reported at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine than any other site, police figures show. That has prompted pro-choice campaigners and some local politicians to call the zones to be extended by up to 250m (820ft). In a statement, the Northern Trust said it would keep the width of the zone under review. Warning: This article contains images which some readers may find distressing. The legislation, which was passed at Stormont in 2022, makes it illegal for people to be "impeded, recorded, influenced or to be caused harassment, alarm or distress" within the eight areas. It is a criminal offence, punishable by a fine of up to £500.  The eight zones can cover between 100m (328ft) and 250m (820ft) from entrances or exits of designated premises. The police have said preliminary figures show that since the zones came into effect on 29 September, there have been 20 incidents at the Northern Trust, resulting in 35 reports to police. The Southern Trust had 11 incidents, while the Western Trust recorded two and the Belfast Trust recorded one. No incidents have been recorded at the South Eastern Trust.  The Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) said their "engage, explain and encourage" approach to policing the new laws had been successful. Only two arrests have been made across Northern Ireland, both at Causeway Hospital, the police have said. In November, a sign comparing Causeway Hospital to a Nazi concentration camp was seized near the Lodge Road Roundabout and three people were cautioned for public order offences by police. Officers were alerted to the sign while attending a report of an alleged assault at a protest at the same time. Lauren McCauley, a member of the pro-choice group, North Coast for Choice, described the posters, placards and imagery such as white crosses, as very distressing. "I believe that the protesters who come here are not showing any remorse or sympathy for those who may need abortion services," Ms McCauley said.  "I would defend anyone's right to protest but nobody needs to protest outside a hospital. "Where the protesters stand is on a very busy roundabout and there are schools nearby." "People feel harassed - you must have some understanding for what people are going through," Ms McCauley said. "The 100-metre safe access zone in place is not enough. It can be extended and should be extended". Gemma Brolly is the deputy leader of the anti-abortion party Aontú. Ms Brolly said that her party did not participate in the protests, but that she did not support the widening of the zones. "I can't see what difference 250 metres is going to make" she told BBC News NI.  "I believe it can only escalate the situation further and I find it worrying and disappointing. "We are watching the deletion of human rights where you can protest with one frame of mind but you cannot with another. "Aontú as a party believe in respectful discourse and compassion and without that, nothing will change." Two East Londonderry assembly members, the SDLP's Cara Hunter and Independent Claire Sugden, are supporting the extension of the zone. Cara Hunter described the imagery being used at the protests as "shocking". "I have spoken to a large number of constituents, both patients and hospital staff who have told about the level of distress they have experienced as a direct result of these protests. "There is a right to protest but for many it's traumatising seeing some of the imagery here. "I have asked the Northern Trust for an interim report to identify concerns from constituents." A former justice minister and Independent MLA Claire Sugden said she also supported extending the zone.  "I appreciate people have a right to an opinion and a right to protest but it is how they are expressing themselves that is causing the issue," Ms Sugden said.  "The imagery is causing distress, not just to new mothers, but to people coming in and out of the hospital. "People have a right to protest but not when others are being harmed by it." In a statement to BBC News NI, the Northern Trust said at Causeway Hospital, the safe access zones were set at 100m following detailed preparation work. "We will continue to keep this under review. While we recognise and acknowledge the legitimate right to peaceful protest, we also have a duty of care to both patients and staff," a spokesperson said.  The Department for Health (DoH) said the safe access zones were monitored by staff and the PSNI. The department said it would produce an annual report on all eight zones' effectiveness. The anti-abortion groups, Precious Life and Abolish Abortion NI declined to comment, on any extension of the zone at Causeway Hospital.
