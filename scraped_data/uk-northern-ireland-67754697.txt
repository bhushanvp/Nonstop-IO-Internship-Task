There was a rise in the number of people being hospitalised with Covid-19 in Northern Ireland in December, according to official figures.  The Public Health Agency (PHA) statistics show a general rising trend in emergency admissions since the start of December - with 38 in the past week.  That is compared to 30 the previous week. The PHA is urging those who are eligible for Covid and flu vaccines to take up the offer.  It said that there are high levels of flu circulating elsewhere in the UK. Dr Maeve Middleton, a public health registrar at the PHA, said flu levels are low in Northern Ireland right now but it is expected to go up. "We are starting to see a small rise and we expect that to increase over the next couple of weeks, particularly over the Christmas and new year period. "With Covid we are seeing a similar trend where we know that it will increase over the next couple of weeks and we are starting to see a slight rise in our hospital admissions. "That is why vaccination is so important for people to protect themselves." Gerard Greene, the chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, said the majority of those who are eligible will have received their Covid and flu vaccines by this stage. "This week pharmacies are extremely busy with a range of other priorities so it's a case of if people feel that they want to get the vaccine, go to their normal pharmacy and see what arrangements the pharmacy may have in place to do the vaccine," he said. "If the pharmacy is not offering the vaccination service a this stage then maybe they will be able to signpost on." Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
