Olly Alexander's mother says being picked to be the UK Eurovision contender is "like a homecoming" for him as they used to watch it together when he was a child. The Years & Years singer announced the news on Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday. His mum Vicki Thornton is the co-founder of the Coleford Music Festival in the Forest of Dean. She said Olly honed his performing skills there as a young singer. She added: "Words can't even explain how I feel about it all. Who could be better than Olly to do Eurovision?" "Music is his first love," she said. "Everyone has taken him into their hearts." Olly gained acclaim with band Years & Years, and has been nominated for a Brit Award six times.  His mum explained it has been "so hard to keep it quiet" about the news over the past few weeks. Ms Thornton said she has already begun looking at flights to the Eurovision 2024 host city of Malmo, Sweden, in May. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.
