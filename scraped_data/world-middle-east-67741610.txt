This video can not be played Vehicles carrying aid through the city of Rafah in Gaza have been mobbed by crowds of people trying to get hold of vital supplies.   Some people climbed onto the trucks and threw boxes to those running after the lorries. In one scene a lorry could be seen swerving, causing aid boxes to come crashing down from the back. In other pictures, dozens of people scrambled to salvage scattered aid boxes lining the middle of the road. At a press conference on Thursday, the UN said that hungry people were stopping lorries carrying supplies, and eating food aid immediately. Â© 2023 BBC.
